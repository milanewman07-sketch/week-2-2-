    <h1>Exercise 1.1</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Open <strong>exercise1-1/sketch.js</strong>. It contains the code from the mousePressAppear example shown in lecture. Run the code 
            to remind yourself of what it does. Try clicking your mouse to make the circle appear and disappear.</p>
            <p>Your task is to edit the sketch to create the output shown in the video below. When the mouse is pressed, a new circle should appear 
                on screen at a random location for every frame that the mouse is pressed. The circles should also 
                stay on screen rather than disappear. Make the following changes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Change the arguments passed to <code>circle()</code> be randomly generated. The x coordinate should be a number between 0 and the 
                width of the screen. The y coordinate should be between 0 and the height of the screen. The diameter of the circle should be between 10 and 
                100 (inclusive).
            </li>
                <li>If you run the code now, you'll see that circles rapidly appear and disappear when the mouse is pressed. This is because <code>background()</code> is 
                called every frame. Remember that the <code>background()</code> function doesn't work the way you might 
                expect if you've used tools like Photoshop, which allow you to paint a layer <em>behind</em> existing shapes. Instead, <code>background()</code> fills the 
                screen with colour, painting <em>over</em> any existing shapes. This causes the flashing effect, where a circle is drawn then immediately 
                painted over on the next frame. To allow the circles to stay on screen, move the <code>background()</code> call into <code>setup()</code>, after the canvas is created.</li>
                <li>Next, see if you can work out how to clear the canvas when a key is pressed. You will need to use the <code>keyIsPressed</code> system variable and 
                an if statement. What goes inside the if statement? The clue is in the previous bullet point! The video below shows the screen being cleared at 7 seconds.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When you are done, check your work using <a href="./check-exercise1-1.html">check-exercise1-1.html</a>.</p>
            <p>Expected output:</p>

                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>You only need to edit sketch.js.</p>
                    <p>For step 1, replace the existing arguments passed to <code>circle()</code> with calls to the <code>random()</code> function. For the 
                    x and y locations, you'll only need to pass <code>random()</code> one argument--the largest number that it can generate. For the circle width, 
                    you'll need to pass <code>random()</code> two numbers: the first should be the smallest number it can generate and the second should indicate the largest 
                    number it can generate.</p>
                    <p>For step 2, delete the call to <code>background()</code> that is currently in <code>draw()</code> and put it at the end of <code>setup()</code> instead.</p>
                    <p>For step 3, the syntax of the <code>if</code> statement should be very similar to the <code>if</code> statement that is already in the sketch but you will 
                    need to use the <code>keyIsPressed</code> system variable instead of <code>mouseIsPressed</code>. To clear the screen, when a key is pressed, call <code>background()</code> inside 
                    the <code>if</code> block. This will paint over all the circles that have been drawn.</p>
