    <h1>Exercise 2.3</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Open <strong>exercise2-3/sketch.js</strong>, add the <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code> functions, and create a 600 by 400 pixel canvas.</p>
            <p>Your task is to convert the sliding circle you should be very familiar with into a bouncing ball. Draw a circle with a diameter of 100px in the 
                top left corner of the canvas. You will need variables to track the x and y locations and the speed and direction of the ball on the x and y axes. This is very 
                similar to the variables used in the sliding circle examples but now you will need to have a second set of variables to handle the ball's 
                movement on the y axis. The ball should move at a speed of 3 pixels per frame on both axes.
            </p>
            <p>The solution to this exercise has a lot in common with both the sliding circle and the previous exercise in this practical.</p>

                    <p>You only need to edit sketch.js.</p>
                    <p>If you are not sure where to start, copy paste the code from one of the slidingCircle examples into the sketch.js 
                        for this exercise. Pick the version that makes most sense to you. Adjust the canvas size and speed of the circle 
                        on the x axis to match the requirements for this exercise. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Next, add variables to manage the circle's speed and direction on the y axis. These should be very similar to the existing 
                        variables. At this point, you should have a circle that moves diagonally across the screen then disappears.
                    </p>
                    <p>The code should have a conditional statement that changes the circle's direction on the x axis when it reaches an edge. Add 
                        another conditional that will do the same for the circle's direction on the y axis.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, make sure your conditionals are written in a way that keeps the circle fully visible on screen, much like you did for 
                        the square in the previous exercise. It is also important that the circle starts from the top left corner, where it should be 
                        fully visible on the canvas.
